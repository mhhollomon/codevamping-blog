### Code Vamping

This is will deal mainly with Software development topics with C++ being a major focus. However, a bit of music will be thrown in from time to time for spice. Needless to say, something that combines both will definitely fit.

The main point of this site is to give me an outlet to explore technologies and topics that don't really fit into my day job.

### The Technology

The site is built with the following techologies (and others):

- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) generates the static pages.
- [Vellichor](https://github.com/mhhollomon/hugo-theme-vellichor) is the theme.
- [netlify](https://netlify.com) does the hosting.
- [Schecter Stilleto](http://www.schecterguitars.com/bass) keeps me mostly sane.

### The Author

Husband, father of two, and a long time devotee to the Oxford comma, I currently work at a large financial services firm developing automation for compiling, reconciling, and transmitting regulatory reports.

My hobbies are musical and include playing the bass guitar, keyboards, and  - to everyone's horror - singing.

\- Mark Hollomon
